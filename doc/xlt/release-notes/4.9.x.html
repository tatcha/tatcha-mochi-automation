            <h2><span class="caps">XLT</span> 4.9.3</h2>
<h3>Script Developer</h3>
<h4>Support Firefox 55 (#2972)</h4>
<p>Script Developer has been made compatible with latest Firefox. It runs on Firefox 45/<span class="caps">ESR</span> up to 55 now.</p>
<h4>Recorded command missed target in case XPath is the only applicable element locator strategy (#2964)</h4>
<p>It might happen that all element locator strategies other than XPath are not applicable because the element in question is not a link, has no <code>id</code> attribute, etc. In such a case, any interaction recorded on such an element missed the command&#8217;s target. As a consequence, the script could not be saved as long as it has not been fixed manually. Fixed.</p>
<h4>Recording preferences not effective (#2967)</h4>
<p>Users might adjust the recording preferences in Script Developer&#8217;s Settings dialog to something different than the defaults (all locator strategies are allowed, no filtering). Unfortunately, these settings were not effective upon record and the defaults were always used instead. This is fixed now.</p>
<h4>Cannot type into file inputs anymore when using Firefox 54+ (#2966)</h4>
<p>Due to an undocumented change in the internal <span class="caps">API</span> of Firefox, typing into input elements of type <code>file</code> always caused an error in Firefox 54+. Fixed.</p>
<h4>Focus is lost when reordering module parameters or test data set rows (#2968)</h4>
<p>When reordering module parameters or items of test data sets, the currently focused text box (row) lost the focus after clicking on the up or down arrow buttons. This means that the element to move (module parameter or data set item) had to be re-selected after each click. If an element needs to be moved a couple of cells in the table this could become very frustrating.</p>
<p>The focused cell will now keep the focus as is already done when reordering items in (global) test data management dialogs.</p>
<h4>WebDriver-friendly handling of invisible/hidden and clickable elements (#2969)</h4>
<p>In contrast to several modern WebDriver implementations such as ChromeDriver or GeckoDriver, ScriptDeveloper allows to interact with elements that are not visible or are overlapped by other elements. Because of this, test cases working perfectly in Script Developer might fail when run with WebDriver for cross-browser testing. As a consequence, you would have to adjust your actually working test cases once again.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why Script Developer now offers a dedicated option in its settings to be more WebDriver-friendly right from the beginning. Once activated, all element interactions will fail in case the element in question is not visible. Furthermore, the element must also be clickable &#8211; which means that it must be visible and not overlapped by other elements &#8211; in case the interaction to perform is a (double) click, right-click, select, (un)check or mouse up/down/over/out.</p>
<h3>Scripting</h3>
<h4>assertValue and friends should check for <span class="caps">DOM</span> attribute first before falling back to <span class="caps">HTML</span> attribute (#2955)</h4>
<p>The command <code>assertValue</code> and all of its friends (<code>waitForValue</code>, <code>storeValue</code>, etc.) work on the element&#8217;s value which is represented in two ways: as <span class="caps">HTML</span> element attribute and as <span class="caps">DOM</span> attribute whose initial value is usually the same as that of the <span class="caps">HTML</span> attribute.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Script Developer and the HtmlUnit-based implementation of XLT&#8217;s Scripting <span class="caps">API</span> only checked for the <span class="caps">HTML</span> attribute named <code>value</code>. This is in contrast to WebDriver which checks for the existence of a <span class="caps">DOM</span> attribute named <code>value</code> before it falls back to <span class="caps">HTML</span> attribute lookup. Fixed.</p>
<h3>Framework</h3>
<h4>Property file includes should not be restricted to the test suite&#8217;s configuration directory (#2970)</h4>
<p><span class="caps">XLT</span> provides a mechanism to include other property files in your test suite&#8217;s <em>default</em>, <em>project</em>, <em>test</em>, or even <em>dev</em> properties. And, these included property files might even include other ones. However, all of these included property files had to reside in your test suite&#8217;s configuration directory or one of its subdirectories.</p>
<p>This restriction has been relaxed. From now on, you can place your property files to include anywhere in your test suite, but not outside of it.</p>
<h3>Load Testing</h3>
<h4>Print path to directory where downloaded results were saved to (#2971)</h4>
<p>From now on, the Master Controller will print the absolute path to the stored results once download completed successfully. This is to aid you in further processing of the results and might come in handy.</p>
<h4>Improve load distribution when using arrival rates (#2973)</h4>
<p>When using arrival rates together with multiple agents per agent machine, load distribution across agent machines was somewhat suboptimal. While <span class="caps">XLT</span> takes care that the next test case execution will take place on another agent, it didn&#8217;t really ensure that this agent is located preferably also on another machine. As a consequence, a certain agent machine could have to handle multiple consecutive test executions in a row while other machines were idling. This effect was especially problematic when the test case was run for the very first time on an agent as the <span class="caps">JVM</span> needs some time to load and optimize the code, leading to higher <span class="caps">CPU</span> usage at the beginning of the test.</p>
<p>The algorithm used to schedule test case executions has been tuned to avoid such situations. All available machines should be utilized almost equally now.</p>
<h4>Non-existent configuration files cause an error when downloading results (#2975)</h4>
<p>It might happen that one or more configuration files cannot be found in the (remote) agent&#8217;s working directory due to misuse of property includes or whatever. In such a case, each attempt to download results caused an error on the (remote) agent controller and the downloaded results might miss the test configuration entirely. Now the test configuration will be downloaded also partially.</p>
<h2><span class="caps">XLT</span> 4.9.2</h2>
<h3>Script Developer</h3>
<h4>Support Firefox 54 (#2945)</h4>
<p>Script Developer has been made compatible with Firefox 54. Script Developer runs on Firefox 45/<span class="caps">ESR</span> up to 54 now.</p>
<h4>Menu button hard to recognize (#2950)</h4>
<p>According to user feedback, it was too easy to overlook the Script Developer menu. The <em><span class="caps">XLT</span> Script Developer</em> button in the toolbar was sometimes recognized as static text, but not as a button with a drop-down menu behind. In order to make things clear, we renamed the button to <em>Menu</em>.</p>
<h4>Private Browsing mode causes replay of *Eval commands to fail (#2951)</h4>
<p>In case you use Script Developer in a browser window with Private Browsing mode turned on, replaying all <code>...Eval</code> commands and those commands that make use of <span class="caps">DOM</span> locator expressions failed with a security error. Fixed.</p>
<h4>Closing a tab causes Script Developer to enter pause mode (#2954)</h4>
<p>If your test script opens another browser tab and switches to this tab to perform some commands in it, and finally closes this tab with the <code>close</code> command, Script Developer entered pause mode instead of continuing with the script. Fixed.</p>
<h3>Load Testing</h3>
<h4>No GC statistics for G1 (#2940)</h4>
<p>If the G1 garbage collection algorithm is used for your agent JVMs, no GC statistics were available in the <em>Agents</em> section of the load test report. Fixed.</p>
<h4>Agent machines with only private IPs can&#8217;t be listed in ec2_admin (#2962)</h4>
<p>When <code>ec2_admin</code> is used to list the URLs of the participating agent controllers, this worked fine for machine instances with a public IP/<span class="caps">DNS</span> name, but not for instances with only a private IP. Their IPs were listed as <code>&lt;not_available_yet&gt;</code>. Fixed now.</p>
<h3>Framework</h3>
<h4>Pass command line parameters to browsers (#2829)</h4>
<p>For <span class="caps">XML</span> script test cases, the <span class="caps">XLT</span> framework is responsible to create the browser to use according to the configuration in your test suite. Up to now, you could configure just the path to the browser executable. Now there is a new property to specify also custom command line arguments to be passed to the browser:</p>
<pre class="ini"><code class="ini">xlt.webDriver.chrome.browserArgs = --headless</code></pre>
<p>Note that this works for only those Web drivers that actually support passing command line parameters to the browser executable. Currently, this includes <code>chrome</code>, <code>chrome_clientperformance</code>, <code>firefox</code>, <code>firefox_clientperformance</code>, and <code>opera</code>.</p>
<h4>BindException when starting XltChromeDriver (#2956)</h4>
<p>When creating multiple <code>XltChromeDriver</code> (or <code>XltFirefoxDriver</code>) instances in parallel, their creation may fail with a &#8220;java.net.BindException: Address already in use&#8221; error. This was caused by a synchronization issue and is fixed now.</p>
<h4>Failure while dumping a frame page to disk (#2959)</h4>
<p>Storing a (frame) page to disk for later use in the result browser sometimes failed with a <code>NullPointerException</code>. Fixed.</p>
<h2><span class="caps">XLT</span> 4.9.1</h2>
<h3>Load Testing</h3>
<h4>Custom agent controller password not effective for <span class="caps">XLT</span> <span class="caps">AWS</span> images (#2931)</h4>
<p>In <span class="caps">XLT</span> 4.8.2 we introduced the possibility to specify a custom agent controller password as part of the user data when starting new machine instances in the Amazon Cloud. Unfortunately, our <span class="caps">AWS</span> machine images with <span class="caps">XLT</span> pre-installed did not process user data correctly. As a consequence, the custom password did not become effective. Now there are new <span class="caps">XLT</span> images available (labeled &#8220;<span class="caps">XLT</span> 4.9.1&#8221;) that do it better.</p>
<h4>URLs in event messages not clickable (#2925)</h4>
<p>In the <em>Event Details</em> table in the load test report, all distinct events are listed along with their message. If an event message contains a <span class="caps">URL</span>, that <span class="caps">URL</span> used to be clickable, but this was not the case any longer. Fixed.</p>
<h4>Report generator may hang (#2926)</h4>
<p>After creating the load test report, the report generator could get stuck. This happened only if the load test run for which the report is to be created was configured to use the &#8220;transaction killer&#8221; feature, i.e. the setting <code>com.xceptance.xlt.abortLongRunningTransactions</code> was enabled. Fixed now.</p>
<h3>Framework</h3>
<h4>Wrong resource URLs in the result browser (#2919)</h4>
<p>When <span class="caps">XLT</span> stores the result browser for a test case, all resource URLs on an <span class="caps">HTML</span> page will be adjusted to point to the local version of the resource (the one that has been downloaded to disk during the test run). This did not always work correctly for resource URLs in <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> elements. Hence, these resources were effectively missing on the <span class="caps">HTML</span> page in the result browser. Fixed.</p>
<h4>Action missing in result browser (#2924)</h4>
<p>In case an <span class="caps">HTML</span> page action does not finish with a proper <code>HtmlPage</code> object, but another page type (<code>TextPage</code>, for instance), the action did not appear in the result browser, and any request made in the context of that action was listed as part of the following action (if any). Fixed now.</p>
<h4>Cross-origin <span class="caps">XHR</span> broken (#2932)</h4>
<p>When sending an <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> across different domains, an additional &#8220;preflight&#8221; request is made in order to check if the client is allowed to retrieve the requested resource from the server. This mechanism is called <em>cross-origin resource sharing</em> (<span class="caps">CORS</span>). It is implemented in all modern browsers and of course also in HtmlUnit. Unfortunately, the response of the preflight request was cached in XLT&#8217;s browser cache preventing the actual resource request from being executed. Fixed.</p>
<h2><span class="caps">XLT</span> 4.9.0</h2>
<h3>Release Overview</h3>
<p><span class="caps">XLT</span> 4.9.0 is primarily a library update release, but also comes with some new features. This section summarizes the highlights of this release.</p>
<p><span class="caps">XLT</span> now ships with Selenium 3.4.0, the latest version of the WebDriver library. All other core libraries have been updated as well. This also includes HtmlUnit for an improved browser emulation.</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">XLT</span> framework also comes with some functional improvements. In case a JavaScript expression in your script test case could not be evaluated successfully for some reason, the root cause will now be listed as part of the exception message. Libraries that make use of Java&#8217;s built-in logging framework do no longer log to the console, but to XLT&#8217;s log file.</p>
<p>Of course, we have something in the box for load testers as well. The master controller prints the configured load profile when starting a test. Intermediate results downloaded while a load test is still running will now be flagged to distinguish them from final results. The load test report shows the number of entries in a data table, and when filtering a data table, the footer row is updated accordingly. Load test reports may also be created for only a subset of the agents. Last but not least, <code>ec2_admin</code> prints more details about running <span class="caps">AWS</span> machine instances and lets you review your choice before actually terminating running instances.</p>
<p>Continue reading to get all the details.</p>
<h3>Framework</h3>
<h4>Selenium / FirefoxDriver</h4>
<p>Selenium has been updated to version 3.4.0. If you want to use <code>FirefoxDriver</code>, you also need to update your <code>geckodriver</code> to version 0.16.1. Please download it from <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases">here</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, <code>geckodriver</code> is <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/QA/Marionette/WebDriver/status">not complete yet</a> and still has bugs. Until there are significant improvements, you might be better off running <code>FirefoxDriver</code> in legacy mode. In this mode, a special extension will be installed into Firefox that takes over the role of <code>geckodriver</code>. In our experience, the legacy mode is more mature.</p>
<p>To switch between geckodriver mode and legacy mode, change the following setting in the test suite configuration as needed:</p>
<pre class="ini"><code class="ini">xlt.webDriver.firefox.legacyMode = true
xlt.webDriver.firefox_clientperformance.legacyMode = true</code></pre>
<p>If you prefer to programmatically create your <code>FirefoxDriver</code> (or <code>XltFirefoxDriver</code>) instances yourself, use the following code:</p>
<pre class="java"><code class="java">FirefoxOptions options = new FirefoxOptions().setLegacy(true);
FirefoxDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver(options);</code>

<code class="java">// or alternatively
FirefoxOptions options = new FirefoxOptions().setLegacy(true);
DesiredCapabilities caps = new DesiredCapabilities();
options.addTo(caps);
driver = new FirefoxDriver(caps);</code></pre>
<blockquote class="warning">
<p class="warning">Note that the legacy Firefox extension shipped with Selenium is not signed by Mozilla, so you won&#8217;t be able to run your tests against stock Firefox, version 48 or higher, as these versions allow to run signed extensions only. Either downgrade your Firefox to version 47.0.1 or, even better, use the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations/">Extended Support Release</a> of Firefox (Firefox 52/<span class="caps">ESR</span>).</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
<p><strong>JavaScript error details</strong> &#8211; If a script test case uses a custom JavaScript code snippet as part of an <code>...Eval</code> command and the snippet could not be executed successfully, this is mostly caused by typos or attempts to access <code>null</code> objects. The resulting exception message now contains more details about the root cause of the error which will often give you a direct hint how to fix the error. No need to dig into log files any longer to get this information.</p>
<pre class="plain"><code class="plain">Command failed: storeEval target="document.getElementByID('foo').getAttribute('bar')" value="myVar" -&gt; Failed to evaluate JavaScript: unknown error: TypeError: document.getElementByID is not a function</code>

<code class="plain">Command failed: storeEval target="document.getElementById('foo').getAttribute('bar')" value="myVar" -&gt; Failed to evaluate JavaScript: unknown error: TypeError: Cannot read property 'getAttribute' of null</code></pre>
<p><strong>Logging</strong> &#8211; <span class="caps">XLT</span> uses Log4J as its logging back end. Some 3rd-party libraries, however, log to Java&#8217;s built-in logging facility from package <code>java.util.logging</code>. Previously, messages logged this way were written to <code>stderr</code>. Now they will be rerouted to Log4J and appear in the regular <span class="caps">XLT</span> log file.</p>
<p><strong>New name for seed value</strong> &#8211; <span class="caps">XLT</span> stores the seed value of <code>XltRandom</code> used for the current test case iteration to the <em>value log</em> of the current session. The value was renamed to <code>com.xceptance.xlt.random.initValue</code>. This way, the corresponding table row in the result browser can simply be copied to your project configuration, for instance to <code>dev.properties</code>, in case you need to replay the test case with the same &#8220;randomness&#8221;.</p>
<h3>Load Testing</h3>
<h4>Load Test Execution</h4>
<p><strong>Load profile</strong> &#8211; Now the Master Controller prints the configured load profile to the console when starting a load test and also when displaying the current status. This helps to spot test configuration mistakes earlier.</p>
<p><strong>Intermediate results</strong> &#8211; If you download intermediate results during a load test and create temporary test reports, the corresponding target directories will now be named <code>&lt;timestamp&gt;-intermediate</code>, while results downloaded after the load test has finished, will still be named <code>&lt;timestamp&gt;</code> only. This way it is easier for you to distinguish between intermediate data and final data.</p>
<h4>Load Test Report</h4>
<p><strong>Number of table entries</strong> &#8211; All tables now display the number of table entries in the left-most footer cell. When using the filter feature, the number is updated accordingly.</p>
<p class="illustration"><img src="../img/releasenotes/4.9.0/report_number_of_table_entries.png" title="Number of table entries" alt="Number of table entries" /></p>
<p><strong>Footer row while filtering</strong> &#8211; When filtering data tables, the table footer row with the summarized values will not disappear any longer, but will be updated according to the shown subset of table entries. But note that some values (esp. percentiles) cannot be recalculated on the fly and will therefore be empty.</p>
<p class="illustration"><img src="../img/releasenotes/4.9.0/report_summary_row_when_filtering.png" title="Footer row values also when filtering" alt="Footer row values also when filtering" /></p>
<p><strong>Report for a subset of agents</strong> &#8211; Sometimes you might need to create reports for certain agent machines only, for instance, if you want to compare response times for agents in different regions of the world or skip an agent that had issues during the load test. The report generator provides new switches to specify the agents to be included in (or excluded from) the report.</p>
<p>To include certain agents only, use this command line:</p>
<pre class="plain"><code class="plain">./create_report.sh --include-agents "ac01_00,ac05_01" ../results/20170410-110432</code></pre>
<p>Likewise, to exclude all agents with &#8216;us-east-1&#8217; in their name, use this command line:</p>
<pre class="plain"><code class="plain">./create_report.sh --exclude-agents ".*us-east-1.*" ../results/20170410-110432</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, you may not only specify a list of plain agent names (comma-separated) but also a (comma-separated) list of regular expressions.</p>
<h4>ec2_admin</h4>
<p><strong>Show instance details</strong> &#8211; There is a new menu option <strong>(d)</strong> in ec2_admin. Use this option to print more details about running or pending machine instances.</p>
<p><strong>Review instances to terminate</strong> &#8211; When terminating machine instances, all instances matching your choice will now be listed for review before they are actually terminated. This helps to avoid terminating the wrong instances by accident.</p>
<pre class="plain"><code class="plain">Filter instances by one or more tags:
 (0) Do not filter (select all)
 (1) Name=LoadTest_1
 (2) Name=LoadTest_2
=&gt; 1</code>

<code class="plain">You selected to terminate instances tagged with:  Name=LoadTest_1</code>

<code class="plain">  in region: eu-west-2 ... OK</code>

<code class="plain">    2 running and 0 pending instance(s) found.

<h3>Script Developer</h3>
<p>Script Developer has been made compatible with the latest available Firefox version, while outdated versions are not supported any longer. Script Developer runs on Firefox 45/<span class="caps">ESR</span> up to 53 now.</p>
<p><strong>Update Instructions:</strong> Firefox won&#8217;t auto-update older versions of Script Developer to 4.9.0. You will need to do this manually. Please remove the currently installed version first and install the new version afterwards by simply dragging and dropping the file <code>&lt;xlt&gt;/tools/xlt-scriptdeveloper-4.9.0.xpi</code> onto Firefox. Auto-updating within the 4.9.x product line will then work as usual again.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can visit the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/xceptance-script-developer/">Mozilla Add-On marketplace</a> to install Script Developer. Please make sure you uninstall your locally installed version first.</p>
<h3>Demo Application Server</h3>
<p><span class="caps">XLT</span> ships with an application server that hosts our demo applications, such as the  <em>Posters Store</em>. By default, the server uses <span class="caps">TCP</span> port 8080 to listen for <span class="caps">HTTP</span> requests, or 8443 for <span class="caps">HTTPS</span> respectively. Since these ports are often already used by other applications, you can now reconfigure them easily. To this end, open the file <code>&lt;xlt&gt;/samples/app-server/start.ini</code> and customize the ports as needed:</p>
<pre class="ini"><code class="ini">## the ports to use for HTTP and HTTPS
jetty.http.port=8080
jetty.ssl.port=8443</code></pre>
<blockquote class="warning">
<p class="warning">In contrast to regular properties files, the file <code>start.ini</code> does not allow whitespace before or after the <code>=</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="note">
<p class="note">Make sure you also reconfigure the start <span class="caps">URL</span> in your test suites accordingly.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Posters Store</h3>
<p>Our demo application <em>Posters Store</em> now runs with <span class="caps">HTTPS</span> only. Any <span class="caps">HTTP</span> request will be redirected to use <span class="caps">HTTPS</span>.</p>
<h3>Incompatible Changes</h3>
<h4>HtmlUnit</h4>
<p>If you use the HtmlUnit <span class="caps">API</span> directly, please be aware that HtmlUnit comes with a bunch of breaking <span class="caps">API</span> changes, which might affect your test cases:</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>InteractivePage</code> and <code>SvgPage</code> have been removed, use <code>HtmlPage</code> instead.</li>
	<li>The method <code>PromptHandler.handlePrompt()</code> has got a third parameter, the default value.</li>
	<li>The methods <code>WebRequest.getCharset()</code>, <code>WebResponse.getContentCharset()</code>, and <code>WebResponse.getContentCharsetOrNull()</code> now return a <code>Charset</code> object instead of the character set name.</li>
	<li>The method <code>DomNode.getByXPath()</code> now returns <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> instead of <code>List&lt;?&gt;</code>.</li>
	<li>To set multiple files at a <code>HtmlFileInput</code>, use the new method <code>setFiles()</code> instead of <code>setValueAttribute()</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The full list of changes from v2.24 to v2.26 can be found <a href="http://htmlunit.sourceforge.net/changes-report.html">here</a>.</p>
<h4>FirefoxDriver / XltFirefoxDriver</h4>
<p>Selenium removed some of the previously existing constructors in <code>FirefoxDriver</code>. As a consequence, <code>XltFirefoxDriver</code> is no longer able to support them either. This may or may not affect your test case code, but only if you programmatically create your driver instances yourself. <span class="caps">XML</span> script test cases are not affected.</p>
